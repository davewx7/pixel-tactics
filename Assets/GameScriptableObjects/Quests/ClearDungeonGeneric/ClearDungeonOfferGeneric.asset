  message: There is a dark cavern near us, with dungeon_description within. Each Winter,
    many dark denizens come forth from it wreaking havoc upon the countryside. We
    would appreciate you entering this cavern and slaying the creatures within.
  options:
  - text: <color=#aaffaa>[Accept]</color> The denizens of the underworld being allowed
      to pillage Wesnoth at their whim is not tolerable to me. I will of course deal
      with this threat at once.

    instructions: []
    conditions: 
  - text: <color=#ffaaaa>[Hostile]</color> You would see me go down into some deep
      dark cave? Surely this is some plot of yours to see me perish in the Underworld.
      For your treachery, prepare to die!

    instructions: []
    conditions: 
  - text: <color=#aaffff>[Diplomacy]</color> I do wish to prove myself worthy of the
      throne, but perhaps there is something different I can do to prove myself?
