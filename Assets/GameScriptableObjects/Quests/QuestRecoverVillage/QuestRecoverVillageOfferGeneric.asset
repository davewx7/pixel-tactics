  message: 'The village of quest_village_recapture_name has been a close ally of ours
    since times of old. Yet now the Queen has occupied it with her forces and torments
    and taxes them.


    We dare not oppose her, yet if you can show that you will not allow the people
    to be harrassed by her by recapturing the village it will surely bolster your
    claim to the throne.'
  options:
  - text: <color=#aaffaa>[Accept]</color> I will not stand for your subjects being
      tormented by the Queen. I vow to recapture the village and soon!

    conditions: 
  - text: <color=#aaffff>[Diplomacy]</color> I do wish to prove myself worthy of the
      throne, but perhaps there is something different I can do to prove myself?
