  message: 'We have a young unit_foster_lord among us, unit_foster_name. unit_foster_He
    must learn the ways of the world, must advance up through the ranks, must not
    be coddled as unit_foster_he would be among us.


    We ask that you be willing to take unit_foster_name among your ranks. Train unit_foster_him
    up to be skilled and accomplished, a leader. If you can do this it would grow
    trust between us. Perhaps we would even deem you suitable for the throne. Will
    you agree to this?


    <i>You will commit to advance unit_foster_name to level 2 within 12 rounds if
    you accept this quest.</i>'

      young nobles. I will both protect them and train them as part of my forces.

      throne, but perhaps there is something different I can do to prove myself?
