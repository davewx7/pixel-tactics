  message: 'In the days of old, the rulers of Wesnoth would come to visit and break
    bread with us. Yet it has been more than a century since a ruler of Wesnoth set
    foot in our domains, as humble as they are. Come and visit our castle and we shall
    discuss with you whether we should support your claim.


    <i>You will commit to visiting npc_team castle with player_lisar within 12 Rounds
    if you accept this quest.</i>'
  options:
  - text: <color=#aaffaa>[Accept]</color> Of course, a wise ruler should visit their
      subjects and I would be happy to have a face-to-face meeting with your ruler.
    result: {fileID: 0}
    instructions: []
    conditions: 
  - text: <color=#ffaaaa>[Hostile]</color> A ruler has more important things to do
      than make a tedious journey to visit a vassal. I demand obedience and will not
      be summoned like a lap-dog.
    result: {fileID: 0}
    instructions: []
    conditions: 
  - text: <color=#aaffff>[Diplomacy]</color> I do wish to prove myself worthy of the
      throne, but perhaps there is something else I can do to prove myself to you?
