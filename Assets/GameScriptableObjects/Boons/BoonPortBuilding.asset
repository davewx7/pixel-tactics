    <i>"With the world at war, many of the great trade routes have been destroyed,"</i>
    He starts. <i>"Cut off the trade routes. Rule the world. Or something of that
    nature. I myself had the misfortune to have my ship attacked on the high seas.
    Ended up washing up here. Yet I''ll tell you, this place looks like with a good
    set of docks built it could serve as a place for ships to make port. With your
    help and support I would be happy to get the townspeople together to build some
    docks and establish this place as a port. It could be an important key to your
    kingdom. What say you?"</i>'
