  dialogStorylineText: '<i>"You made it all the day down here did you? Glad to have
    you save us. But maybe you''re looking for a way out now?"</i> the man asks, a
    wry grin on his face.


    <i>"Why, you didn''t think the way you came in was the only way in did you? Oh
    no, we have a nice little secret passage back to the surface tucked away back
    here. Maybe you''d like to see it?"</i> The Dwarf holds up a lantern and offers
    to show you an alternative way out of this gloomy cave.'
  declineStoryText: Never follow a dwarf in a cave. Or so your mother taught you.
    You decline his offer and explore this little subterranean village instead.
