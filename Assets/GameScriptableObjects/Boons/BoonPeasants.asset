  dialogStorylineText: As you enter the village, you are approached by several pitchfork-wielding
    farmers. They seem to be out for blood, but gladly not yours. <i>"We welcome you
    as much as we have welcomed any who come here. And we would like to aid you. Our
    village is threatened by invaders and we would help you fight them off!"</i>
  declineStoryText: Professional fighters win wars, not rabble. You find more productive
    things for these peasants to work on than act as cannon-fodder.
