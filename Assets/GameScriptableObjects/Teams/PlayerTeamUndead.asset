  playerStoryText:
  - 'The Necromancers will rise again. It is our creed, uttered to start and end each
    and every one of our meetings. '
  - 'I believe that once again a mighty Lich-King might sit the throne, as it was
    in the days of old. Yet, the Necromancers I have been taught and trained by do
    not see this vision. They wish to hold onto some dim, dark, limited version of
    what Necromancy can do. They do not understand that given the chance to understand
    us, the people will welcome us with open arms. '
  - 'And that is why after careful plotting and planning, today I rise up, I summon
    my own dark legion. It is written that every great Sorcerer arises by vanquishing
    his own master first. And that, I shall eagerly do. '
  - 'Come, my servants, rise up and prepare to fight for me. I, Muff-Malal, will be
    Grand Necromancer of all the land, and claim the throne for myself. '
  - 'Soon, I will sit the throne, for when my subjects see my power, they will wish
    to do nothing but bow the knee and serve me. I am Muff-Malal, lord of the undead,
    and through my power I will wrest the throne from all who oppose me. '
