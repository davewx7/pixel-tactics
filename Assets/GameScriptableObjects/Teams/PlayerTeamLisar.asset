  playerStoryText:
  - I knew I had to get out of that room. Out of that castle. Out of that city. I
    had to get far, far away.
  - I realized she would never let me assume my rightful place as Queen. She would
    see my head on a pike before she let that happen. This woman who was once my mother
    had been corrupted by power.
  - And so I waited. I planned. With the help of my servants I stole away from Weldyn
    in the mid of night. I had to reach Nierloch, my family's ancestral home. There
    I would try to raise support.
  - Wesnoth was not the land I had once known. The reign of Asheviere was taking its
    toll. Bandits, wolves, and fouler beasts wandered the land. The journey was harrowing,
    but in the end I arrived at Nierloch.
  - Now, I make my claim. Today my reign truly begins. I shall stake my claim. For
    I am Li'sar, rightful Queen of Wesnoth.
