  playerStoryText:
  - I was raised among the Elves. Taught and trained in their ways. Yet I was not
    one of them.
  - I had always been told that one day my life might be in danger. That I had enemies
    who would never stop searching for me.
  - I did not truly believe it until the day the orcs came. Bands of them. Hired by
    the Queen, determined to snuff out my name.
  - I did not ask for this fight, but I knew I could not run from it. With the support
    of the Elves I would make my claim.
  - I am Konrad, rightful King of Wesnoth, and today my reign begins.
